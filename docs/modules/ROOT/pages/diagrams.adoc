= Diagrams

== Overview

Antora does not support diagrams from textual descriptions by default. In order to include diagrams from textual descriptions several extensions are available.

== Extensions

In this example the xref:diagrams/extensions/kroki.adoc[Kroki] extension is used in favour of xref:diagrams/extensions/plantuml.adoc[PlantUML], because it supports a lot of additional link:https://kroki.io/#support[diagram types].

== Diagram Types

Diagram types, which are rendered with link:https://kroki.io/#support[Kroki]:

* xref:diagrams/types/plantuml.adoc[PlantUML]

== Styles

Diagrams can be defined <<Inline>>, as well as with <<Includes>>. 
To show how it works PlantUML diagrams are used. However, this is completely independet form the diagram type.

=== Inline

In order to generate a diagram, you should write your text inside a block, for example a `plantuml` block:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[plantuml, format="svg", id="myDiagram"]
----
Bob -> Alice : hello
Alice -> Bob : hi
----
....

The above blocks will be converted to an HTML image tag with source pointing to the rendered image. 

[plantuml, format="png"]
----
Bob -> Alice : hello
Alice -> Bob : hi
----

=== Includes

It is also possible include diagrams from files. Non-AsciiDoc files that contain reusable content are called examples in Antora and saved in the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/{antora_version}/examples-directory/[examples-directory]

An example, like a PlantUML diagram, can be included by adding a link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/{antora_version}/page/include-an-example/[include directive with the resource id of the example] within a block, like in this example within a `plantuml` block:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[plantuml, format="svg"]
----
\include::example$diagrams/plantuml-single-diagram.plantuml[]
----
....

The above blocks will be converted to an HTML image tag with source pointing to the rendered image.

[plantuml, format="svg"]
----
include::example$diagrams/plantuml-single-diagram.plantuml[]
----

A textual diagram description from a file which contains multipe diagrams can be included by the use of tags in order to specify regions.

In a PlantUML file, a region can be defined by a beginning tag `'tag::name[]` and an end tag `'end::name[]`. 
For each diagram type the character `'` must be replaced with the comment indicator of the respective diagram type.

The PlantUML file `plantuml-multiple-diagram.plantuml` has the defined tags `first_diagram` and `second_diagram`.

[source,plantuml]
----
include::example$diagrams/plantuml-multiple-diagrams.plantuml[]
----

Diagrams from a multi diagram file can be included by adding a include directive with a tag within a block, like in this example within a `plantuml` block:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[plantuml, format="svg"]
----
\include::example$diagrams/plantuml-multiple-diagrams.plantuml[tag=first_diagram]
----

[plantuml, format="svg"]
----
\include::example$diagrams/plantuml-multiple-diagrams.plantuml[tag=second_diagram]
----
....

The above blocks will be converted to HTML image tags with sources pointing to the rendered.

[plantuml, format="svg"]
----
include::example$diagrams/plantuml-multiple-diagrams.plantuml[tag=first_diagram]
----

[plantuml, format="svg"]
----
include::example$diagrams/plantuml-multiple-diagrams.plantuml[tag=second_diagram]
----
