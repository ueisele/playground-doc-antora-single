If you're new to using Mermaid or need help identifying issues in your Mermaid code, the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) is a helpful tool for creating and resolving issues within Mermaid diagrams.

== Syntax GitLab

How to use Mermaid with GitLab is described at the GitLab Markdown Documentation in the section [Diagrams and Flowcharts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#diagrams-and-flowcharts).

In order to generate a diagram or flowchart, you should write your text inside the `mermaid` block:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[mermaid]
----
graph TD;
  A-->B;
  A-->C;
  B-->D;
  C-->D;
----

        :                         ^

Subgraphs can also be included:

```mermaid
graph TB

  SubGraph1 --> SubGraph1Flow
  subgraph "SubGraph 1 Flow"
  SubGraph1Flow(SubNode 1)
  SubGraph1Flow -- Choice1 --> DoChoice1
  SubGraph1Flow -- Choice2 --> DoChoice2
  end

  subgraph "Main Graph"
  Node1[Node 1] --> Node2[Node 2]
  Node2 --> SubGraph1[Jump to SubGraph1]
  SubGraph1 --> FinalThing[Final Thing]
end
```
