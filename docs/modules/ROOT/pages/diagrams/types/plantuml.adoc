= PlantUML

It's possible to generate diagrams and flowcharts from text in Antora using link:https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML].

PlantUML is a component that allows to quickly write diagrams using a simple and intuitive textual language.
The textual language in which diagrams can be defined is also called PlantUML (see link:https://plantuml.com/guide[PlantUML Language Reference Guide]).

If you're new to using PlantUML or need help identifying issues in your PlantUML code, the link:http://plantuml.com/plantuml/[PlantUML Live Editor] is a helpful tool for creating and resolving issues within PlantUML diagrams.

TIP: PlantUML supports not only UML diagram types, but also other link:https://plantuml.com/en/[diagram types] like Gantt and Mindmap.

TIP: Besides PlantUML specific textual descriptions, PlantUML supports also link:https://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz (DOT)] and link:http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/[Ditaa].

== Integration

=== Antora

Integration of PlantUML in Antora is achievied by xref:diagrams/extensions/kroki.adoc[Kroki] or xref:diagrams/extensions/plantuml.adoc[PlantUML] extension.

In order to generate a diagram or flowchart, you should write your text inside the `plantuml` block.

=== VSCode

VSCode can render PlantUML in AsciiDoc with the VSCode link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoc extension] and a configured xref:diagrams/extensions/kroki.adoc#_vscode[Kroki server] or xref:diagrams/extensions/plantuml.adoc#_vscode[PlantUML server].

=== DOT (Graphviz)

link:https://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz] is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
The graph description languange which is used by Graphviz is link:https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/lang.html[dot].

Since link:https://plantuml.com/en/dot[PlantUML uses DOT/Graphviz], it is possible to directly use DOT language.

== Unsupported Functionality and Diagram Types

=== !Include Directive

xref:diagrams/extensions/kroki.adoc[Kroki] does not support the `!include` and `!includeurl` directive. 

=== Ditaa

link:http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/[Ditaa] interprets ascci art as a series of open and closed shapes, but it also uses special markup syntax to increase the possibilities of shapes and symbols that can be rendered.

xref:diagrams/extensions/kroki.adoc[Kroki] does not support `ditaa` rendered by `PlantUML`.
