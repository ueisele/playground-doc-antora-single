= PlantUML

PlantUML is a component that allows to quickly write diagrams using a simple and intuitive textual language.
The textual language in which diagrams can be defined is also called PlantUML (see link:https://plantuml.com/guide[PlantUML Language Reference Guide]).

Besides UML diagrams, PlantUML supports also non-UML diagram types like Ditaa and Graphiz (DOT), Gantt and MindMap.
A full list of supported PlantUML diagram types is given on the link:https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML Webpage].

PlantUML also provides an HTTP API to create diagrams from textual descriptions, which is also used by the Asciidoc PlantUML extension. 

If you're new to using PlantUML or need help identifying issues in your PlantUML code, the link:http://plantuml.com/plantuml/[PlantUML Live Editor] is a helpful tool for creating and resolving issues within PlantUML diagrams.

== Antora

Antora integration is achieved with the Asciidoctor.js PlantUML extension link:https://github.com/eshepelyuk/asciidoctor-plantuml.js[asciidoctor-plantuml].

=== Installation

The extension can be installed via `npm`:

[source,bash]
----
npm install asciidoctor-plantuml
----

Alternatively, it can also be specified in the `package.json` file of the Antora project.

.package.json
[source,json]
----
  "devDependencies": {
    "asciidoctor-plantuml": "^1.5.0"
  }
----

=== Configuration

The extensions can be activated by adding it to the `asciidoc` section of the Antora playbook.

.antora-playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    plantuml-server-url: "http://plantuml.com/plantuml"
    plantuml-fetch-diagram: true
  extensions:
  - asciidoctor-plantuml  
----

The `plantuml-server-url` attribute is important, because the extension uses the PlantUML server to render diagrams.
By default, this extension sends information and receives diagrams back from http://plantuml.com/plantuml.
However, it is also possible to run it as a link:https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server[self-managed server], for example using Docker.

TIP: You can use the `plantuml-fetch-diagram` option to download the images from PlantUML at build time. In other words, while viewing pages you won't rely on Kroki anymore.

== VSCode

All you need to do is to get the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoc extension], and set the PlantUML server Url.

The option we will use for this feature is `asciidoc.preview.attributes` that allows you to set arbitrary AsciiDoc attributes. These attributes will be injected into the preview.
This extension needs the `:plantuml-server-url:` attribute to be set in the AsciiDoc document to become active and parse PlantUML blocks.

So all you need to do in VS Code is to hop into your user settings and add the following entry:

[source,json]
----
"asciidoc.preview.attributes": {
  "plantuml-server-url": "http://plantuml.com/plantuml"
}
----

The downside of using the public server is that it does not offer SSL encrypted endpoints and you must weaken your VS Code security settings to preview correctly.
To do this open your command palette (âŒ˜+P, ctrl+shift+P) and enter `asciidoc preview security` and choose `Allow insecure content`.

It is also possible to run it as a link:https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server[self-managed server], for example using Docker.
